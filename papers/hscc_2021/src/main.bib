We show that this closed form solution is piecewise linear and continuous. As a practical consequence of the result, constrained linear quadratic regulation becomes attractive also for systems with high sampling rates, as on-line quadratic programming solvers are no more required for the implementation.},

abstract = "Dealing with uncertainties is one of the most challenging issues that prevent nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) from being a widespread reality. Many different robust schemes have been presented recently, such as multi-stage NMPC, in which the uncertainty is represented as a scenario tree. While multi-stage NMPC achieves promising performance in practice, it suffers from an exponential increase in complexity with the number of uncertainties considered making its real-time application difficult for large case studies. We suggest in this work to use multi-stage NMPC as a generator of data pairs that are used to learn the robust NMPC policy by means of deep neural networks. This choice is motivated by recent practical successes of deep learning and theoretical results that explain the improved representation capabilities of deep networks with respect to shallow networks. We present empirical evidence which shows that the use of deep neural networks with many hidden layers as opposed to shallow networks with only one significantly improves the learning process of a robust NMPC control law. These findings are illustrated with simulation studies of an industrial polymerization reactor."

abstract = {Optimal solutions to Markov decision problems may be very sensitive with respect to the state transition probabilities. In many practical problems, the estimation of these probabilities is far from accurate. Hence, estimation errors are limiting factors in applying Markov decision processes to real-world problems. We consider a robust control problem for a finite-state, finite-action Markov decision process, where uncertainty on the transition matrices is described in terms of possibly non-convex sets. We show that perfect duality holds for this problem, and that as a consequence, it can be solved with a variant of the classical dynamic programming algorithm, the “robust dynamic programming” algorithm. We show that a particular choice of the uncertainty sets, involving likelihood regions or entropy bounds, leads to both a statistically accurate representation of uncertainty, and a complexity of the robust recursion that is almost the same as that of the classical recursion. Hence, robustness can be added at practically no extra computing cost. We derive similar results for other uncertainty sets, including one with a finite number of possible values for the transition matrices. We describe in a practical path planning example the benefits of using a robust strategy instead of the classical optimal strategy; even if the uncertainty level is only crudely guessed, the robust strategy yields a much better worst-case expected travel time.},
